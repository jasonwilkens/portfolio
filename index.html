		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>UX design is a big umbrella, covering a lot of folks with different skills. I'm not big on of the seemingly never-ending definition of terms that goes on in this field &mdash; the parsing of differences between interaction designers, product designers, UX architects, and so on. But I do want to provide a good idea of who I am as a designer and what I like to do.</p>
		<p class="small">I like a hockey stick with a very slightly curved blade. Good for flipping pancakes, not so good for scooping melons. As a designer, I'm good at designing a software product or a design system for the web. I'm not so good at designing a logo or a beautiful illustration.</p>

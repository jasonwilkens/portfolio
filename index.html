                <h2>LinkedIn<br/><small>Designing at scale</small></h2>
                <p>I came to LinkedIn in 2014 through the Bizo acquisition and worked primarily on advertising products. I learned a lot and brought some Bizo goodness to LinkedIn's huge base of advertisers. After doing design here for almost two years, I moved into front-end engineering to sharpen my coding skills.</p>

                <p>I joined Bizo in 2012 as the 75th employee, and first UX designer. From the time I interviewed I could tell it was a special place, and joining was the best decision of my career. I wanted to do UX on my own terms, and worked with the team to develop an innovative approach to product design. It paid off, and we were <a href="https://adexchanger.com/social-media/linkedin-q2-revenue-soars-says-bizo-will-anchor-b2b-marketing-tools/" target="_blank">acquired by LinkedIn</a> in 2014.</p>

                <p>Moving out to San Francisco in 2010 and designing for Esurance was a big step in my career. I learned about e-commerce working on the insurance quoting and purchasing experience. Every change I made impacted the bottom line, so we tested and measured like nowhere I've seen since. It was thrilling to work on something with so much impact.</p>

              <h2>Building web products</h2>
              <p>I apply a user-centered design process that depends on iteration, customer feedback, and developing domain expertise. As I've grown as a designer, I've learned how to adapt that process to the challenges that come with product design on the web.</p>
              <p>I consistently hear from other designers who are struggling to bring real change to their products, especially in the enterprise space. Their complaints have a common theme: There aren't enough engineers. The product managers won't prioritize design improvement. A redesign isn't worth the cost. Eventually they get burned out. Their best hope is to persuade stakeholders to change their priorities with a great design presentation. An uphill battle, and a never-ending one.</p>
              <p>I believe this is a solvable problem. Fixing it requires designers and stakeholders to reach outside their traditional comfort zones. When you can go no further, change. You will make it through.</p>
              <h3>Design craftsmanship</h3>
              <p>On an organizational level, a design group should learn how to change their products as much as possible while asking as little as possible from product management and engineering. You might think that I'm about to say &ldquo;designers should code&rdquo;, but the real requirement is only that the design <em>organization</em> should be capable of producing final designs in code. Design should be able to define the content and presentation layers for their products (HTML and CSS). Engineering should optimize and improve the code for production, but even taking this first step removes a tremendous amount of friction from product development and enables design craftsmanship in the end user experience.</p>
              <div class="sidebar">
                <p>My engineering counterpart at Bizo wrote about <a href="http://www.draconianoverlord.com/2016/07/22/staffing-a-front-end-team.html" target="_blank">his perspective</a> on this model.</p>
              </div>
              <p>Delivering final designs in code reduces the engineering cost to implement them. It provides a shared context for design and engineering collaboration and learning. It also prevents design bugs that can take additional effort to fix. The reduced engineering costs for design changes make them less costly to prioritize, producing a virtuous cycle of design improvement.</p>
              <div class="img-container-25">
                <img src="images/process/sketch.jpg" alt="Sketch of a metric table design">
                <p>starting an idea with a simple sketch&hellip;</p>
              </div>
              <p>For the design team, a code-based style library enables design consistency, clarity, and scalability in a way that image-based tools will never match.</p>
              <h3>Dedicated resources</h3>
              <p>Design-led presentation layer code is a great first step. The next step is devoting dedicated engineering resources to design improvement. The surest way to degrade a product over time is to prioritize by weighing any design changes against new features. Design improvements provide long-term value and are hard to measure directly, so the new features will win every time.</p>
              <p>I helped a team solve this problem by setting a fixed percentage of our engineering budget each sprint for design improvements. I'd negotiate with the product team, but the design tasks for this dedicated budget were prioritized by design. If you have a design-oriented product manager you might not need to take on this responsibility, but I like when designers prioritize their design improvements. It fosters appreciation for the costs of the engineering work that provides valuable focus.</p>
              <h3>Taking control</h3>
              <div class="sidebar">
                <p>I wrote this based on my experience designing for the web, but tools like <a href="https://flutter.io/" target="_blank">Flutter</a> are making it a viable process for native mobile app design as well.</p>
              </div>
              <p>As an individual contributor, I've always measured my work by its impact on real users. Nice mocks for my portfolio aren't very rewarding. So I get frustrated when a final product doesn't turn out as nicely as my carefully crafted Illustrator mocks. Many great designers have argued for designing in code. For me, the right to control the end result was what sold me.</p>
              <p>I started using image tools less often as I got better at CSS and my design system became more extensive. Eventually, I found that my process started with paper and pencil to explore ideas, then went directly into code to grapple with reality. There was no need for the intermediate step of drawing my whole interface in a graphics program beforehand. I only needed image tools to produce actual images to include in my designs. Using my &ldquo;living styleguide&rdquo; I could quickly build prototypes of entire experiences to demo and conduct research.</p>
              <div class="bizstrap-table-container">
                <hierarchical-table></hierarchical-table>
              </div>
              <p class="floating-caption">&hellip;and bringing it to life in code</p>
              <p>Not every designer should work the way that I do. I believe in letting people focus on their strengths. But many of the design decisions that have to be made for a web experience can't be shown in an image mockup, or even a prototype stitched together from static images. If you really want to control your product look and feel, you have to work directly in its medium. That will only become more true as the web becomes more fluid, animated, and dynamic.</p>
              <p>There's something very rewarding and authentic about working this way. For me it evokes Frank Lloyd Wright's architecture school, whose students don't just design structures while sitting at a desk, they go outside and build the shelters that they live in while at school. Or industrial designers creating physical prototypes. Imagination without constraints is an indispensable part of design, but so is overcoming the challenges of the medium to make real change achievable.</p>
              <h2>Building culture</h2>
              <p>Working in  very different company cultures over the years, I've learned what to look for and help grow in the organizations I'm part of. Things that turn a job into a deeply fulfilling endeavor.</p>
              <div class="img-container-50">
                <img
                  srcset="images/process/culture-1600.jpg 1600w,
                          images/process/culture-800.jpg 800w"
                  sizes="(min-width:70rem) 1120w, 100vw"
                  src="images/process/culture-1600.jpg" alt="Pictures with teammates"
                />
              </div>
              <p>The first is a <strong>culture of commitment</strong> to your colleagues and a common purpose. An innate sense of trust that fosters deep bonds between coworkers. It's easy to sense these kinds of cultures, they feel less stiff and more genuine. It doesn't mean that we always agree, but trust allows us to sort out disagreements productively. It means being your authentic self at work and sharing your perspective honestly. It also makes work a lot more fun. Without these bonds, a job loses its purpose and becomes a quid-pro-quo calculus &mdash; what I am giving and what I am getting.</p>
              <p>A culture of commitment enables the second thing I look for, an <strong>action-oriented culture</strong> where trust allows decision-making to move down the hierarchy. You have enough ownership of your work to make decisions without running them up the chain of command. You are included in decisions that will affect you whenever possible. Trust runs both ways, and people keep their managers informed and their work consistent with the company's standards.</p>
              <p>The last thing I look for is a <strong>focus on productivity</strong> that prevents unnecessary processes from building up. Teams figure out what works for them and modify it over time. Meetings are more likely to be one-offs scheduled for a purpose than recurring time-slots to be filled with content. This is worth underlining because meetings are very expensive. The more people attend, the more expensive the meeting. Sometimes big meetings are worth the cost, and if they are they should feel important and engage their participants.</p>
              <div class="img-container-35">
                <img src="images/process/pm-team.jpg" alt="Bizo PM Team">
                <p>a small but mighty team meeting </p>
              </div>
              <p>I'll admit that these traits are more likely to be found in smaller organizations, but I've also seen cases where adopting some of these qualities can allow larger companies to move faster and feel smaller than they are.</p>
              <p>Creating a great culture is an essential part of my process as a designer and employee. Not only because it's better for productivity, but because it's better for human happiness. Ultimately, what is the point of doing great work and finding success if not to improve human well-being?</p>

              <p>Planning to simplify and update the Bizo platform for Lead Accelerator</p>
            </div>
            <p>With Bizo's acquisition by LinkedIn, we needed to re-skin <router-link to="multichannel-nurturing">Multichannel Nurturing</router-link> with a new look and a new name &mdash; LinkedIn Lead Accelerator. We also needed to integrate LinkedIn feed ads alongside Display and Facebook ads before our relaunch.</p>
            <p>During the product's lifecycle at LinkedIn we also designed some major feature additions and reporting for a new pricing model.</p>
            <h2>Approach</h2>
            <p>Despite the short timeline, re-skinning the Bizo platform was rather straightforward thanks to the <router-link to="bizo-design-system">Bizo Design System</router-link>. Much of the work was swapping CSS colors, adopting the typeography from LinkedIn's style guide, and switching images. When LinkedIn launched an updated visual style, I was able to re-skin the platform again and include the new patterns painlessly.</p>
            <p>Multichannel Nurturing was always intended to add additional ad formats so adding LinkedIn ads wasn't a problem. We did hear from customers that they needed management features to help them re-use groups of ads in multiple campaigns, and more ways to drill down and analyze reporting.</p>
            <img class="project-image"
              src="images/work/linkedin/lead-accelerator/reporting-sketch.jpg" alt="Paper prototype"
            />
            <h2>Solution</h2>

              src="images/work/linkedin/lead-accelerator/wave-1.png" alt="Campaign message UI"
            />
            <p>I put a lot of sweat into Lead Accelerator but despite its strong results at Bizo it wasn't a good fit for LinkedIn's product portfolio and support infrastructure. That writing on the wall inspired a plan called <router-link to="mad-river">Mad River</router-link>, to take Lead Accelerator's technology and design a modern mass-market advertising platform for LinkedIn.</p>

              <p>Visualizing data to make the case for the project</p>
            </div>
            <p>My team was working on <router-link to="lead-accelerator">Lead Accelerator</router-link> while another team in our department was working on LinkedIn's Campaign Manager ad platform. Lead Accelerator was designed for sophisticated B2B marketers but most LinkedIn advertisers are more traditional, or too small to leverage it effectively. Campaign Manager was a self-service platform that anyone could sign up for, but had basic features and was struggling to keep up with our competition.</p>
            <p>The two teams had very different roadmaps and as the lines between products began to blur there was a lot of organizational tension. These circumstances created an opportunity to bring the best technology and analytics from Lead Accelerator to a mass-market platform built on the Campaign Manager base. I started working on a design strategy for a unified advertising platform. We like to nickname our projects at LinkedIn, so I called this one Mad River.</p>
            <h2>Approach</h2>
            <p>I gathered data from product marketing and business analytics to support the case and worked with the other two LMS product designers to create our vision. We drew on our past user research and the assets in LinkedIn's ecosystem to broaden our concept of what the unified platform could be.</p>
            <p>We talked to a couple other LinkedIn design teams that had used design sprints for ideation, and we thought the process made sense for us even though we had a pretty good idea of what we wanted to build. We just needed time to develop it.</p>

              <p>Designs from our presentation</p>
            </div>
            <p>We crafted a vision of an advertising platform that tailored campaigns to a marketer's goals, optimized for their key metrics, and included advanced features like account-based marketing. We presented our designs, the business case, and research findings to LinkedIn's design leadership and our product leadership.</p>
            <p>It turned out that our head of product already wanted to go in this direction, and we were soon merging the two organizations and working on a joint roadmap! It was sad to give up on Lead Accelerator but I'm so proud of the impact we made setting our department on the right path.</p>

            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <div class="sidebar">
              <p>This was one of two mobile projects I designed at LinkedIn. The other was a very cool mystery app we just didn't have resources to build.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Marketers who advertise to businesses instead of consumers usually can't trace ad spend directly to purchases like online retailers can. Most B2B transactions are handled via a sales process and invoicing. So B2B marketers focus on getting leads for their sales team by asking prospects to fill out their contact forms.</p>
            <p>Setting up landing pages, tracking conversions, and linking them back to the ad campaigns is an annoying technical and logistical challenge. Marketers usually rely on engineers to manage these problems, which slows them down.</p>
            <h2>Approach</h2>
            <div class="sidebar">
              <img src="images/work/linkedin/lead-ads/in-feed.jpg" alt="Ad in feed" />
              <img src="images/work/linkedin/lead-ads/form-1.jpg" alt="Lead form" />
              <img src="images/work/linkedin/lead-ads/confirmation.jpg" alt="Completion page" />
            </div>
            <p>I worked with a couple other designers on this project, each of us leading it at a different point in its development. The mocks here are my latest before I handed it off to another designer.</p>
            <p>The goal of this project was to create a contact form experience in the native LinkedIn app (the website version was planned for a later release). Marketers would have a new ad format that would allow them to collect leads seamlessly without linking to an external landing page.</p>
            <p>There were two sides to the project design &mdash; the app flow for filling out a contact form, and the marketer experience for creating lead gen forms and getting their results.</p>
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>We came up with a design that used a prominent call to action to open a short contact form and returned the user to their LinkedIn feed after completion.</p>
            <p>Using image assets from the advertiser's company page and their logo on the form maintains the association with the advertiser and shows where the form information was being sent.</p>
            <p>Along with the LinkedIn feed experience, we designed the feature integration for LinkedIn Campaign Manager's campaign creation flow.</p>
            <p>Knowing that long forms on mobile have very low completion rates, we came up with ways to reduce the fields advertisers could include like Industry and Company Size. If the user provides Company Name in the form, we'll just pass that company's size and industry to the advertiser from the LinkedIn economic graph.</p>
            <p>Lead Gen Forms is still a new product but it's getting a <a href="http://marketingland.com/linkedins-new-matched-audiences-feature-just-blew-facebook-custom-audiences-water-b2b-212213" target="_blank">good reception</a> so far.</p>

            <p class="floating-caption">Onboarding for Multichannel Nurturing</p>
            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>Our Bizo for Marketing Automation product allowed marketers to sync display ads with their automated email campaigns in Eloqua and Marketo. That was all well and good as far as it went, but our product was really just an add-on for those other systems, and constrained by their limitations.</p>
            <p>Product and Engineering asked me to explore the possibility of creating our own marketing automation system centered on display advertising, that would allow a customer to pull in audiences from their website as well as systems like Eloqua and Marketo.</p>
            <h2>Approach</h2>
            <div class="sidebar">
              <img src="images/work/bizo/multichannel-nurturing/nurturing-usage.png" alt="Usage reporting"/>
              <p>We had to build a custom report to support the product's SaaS pricing model.</p>
            </div>
            <p>I started by learning about other marketing automation systems and getting trained on them. These systems are inherently complex. They involve setting system behavior for sending messages based on a recipient's inclusion in certain lists, time that has gone by, and actions they've taken.</p>
            <p>I had to examine the key differences between the mediums of email and display ads, and how they shaped the underlying constraints of the product. You need to be very careful with the amount of emails you send, so email campaigns need wait steps between sending the next email, and they should only send the single most important message. Display ads are more flexible, you can try different marketing messages on your prospects at the same time, and you want to reach your target customers frequently.</p>
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <img class="project-image"
              src="images/work/bizo/multichannel-nurturing/filters.png" alt="Audience targeting"
            />
            <p class="floating-caption">The initial concept for audience targeting in Multichannel Nurturing</p>
            <p>A key insight was that our system should still be loosely based on a paradigm of "campaigns" but those campaigns would have two defining features inspired by marketing automation. The first is the ability to create sophisticated audience targeting by combining Bizo demographic data, external audiences like website retargeting pools and email lists, and customer behavior. The second is that the campaign could serve a sequence of messages to educate and persuade the audience over time toward the customer's goals.</p>
            <img class="project-image"
              src="images/work/bizo/multichannel-nurturing/wave.png" alt="Creatives"
            />
            <p class="floating-caption">A sequential message for a Multichannel Nurturing campaign</p>
            <p>With this concept in mind, I created the first mocks of the campaign flow and reporting UIs. There was an important meeting the next day and I was so inspired that I stayed up all night to get the idea ready to present. It was obvious we were onto something when every person who saw it jumped straight to "Yes, and we should also add..." instead of the usual objections a new product idea faces.</p>

            <p class="floating-caption">Creating a campaign in Multichannel Nurturing</p>
            <p>With the team on board, we built the MVP and started getting traction and customer success. This product had a great impact on our business not just from the revenue it produced, but by leading to Bizo's acquisition by LinkedIn and its evolution into <router-link to="/lead-accelerator">Lead Accelerator</router-link>.</p>

            <p>Less sophisticated marketers tend to judge their campaigns simply by the number of clicks they get, instead of tracking measurement towards their goals and determining a more meaningful ROI.

            <p>I interviewed our customer account managers to find out which ideas would help them tell the right story to their customers, and refined the product based on their expertise. I also tested them with our in-house marketers for additional feedback.</p>

              <p>Going from whiteboard sketch to prototype</p>
            </div>
            <p>Bizo was a fast-paced startup that developed B2B advertising products. In my time there, we built and launched Self-Service Retargeting, Bizo Switchboard, Social Retargeting, Bizo for Marketing Automation, <router-link to="/multichannel-nurturing">Multichannel Nurturing</router-link>, as well as a suite of <router-link to="/analytics">analytics</router-link> tools to support our primary display and social advertising business.</p>
            <p>As a single designer I needed a design system that would streamline the product development and iteration process. I needed to be able to create prototypes as well as actual product designs quickly so we could get them into customers' hands, get feedback, and keep learning.</p>
            <h2>Approach</h2>
            <p>In my interview, Bizo's head of engineering told me they wanted to start using <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> to build their UI, and were looking for a designer who could manage it. Despite my novice CSS skills at the time, I accepted the challenge.</p>
            <p>It was definitely hard at first, you can read a lot more about my evolution in <router-link to="/process">process</router-link>, but safe to say I got the hang of it and even found designing this way felt very natural.</p>
            <p>Working with the engineering team on product designs and having them review my code made us all more efficient and helped me level up my prototyping skills very quickly. I wasn't putting too many cycles into customizing Bootstrap's visual style at this point. You'll probably recognize that "vanilla Bootstrap" look in a lot of the UI elements.</p>
            <img class="project-image"

            />
            <p class="floating-caption">A prototype UI in the Bizo Design System</p>
            <p>What I did spend time on was creating prototypes for all those product flows and validating them. I would build out several versions of a user flow. Once I had a few design options ready, I took them to my teammates, customers, and our field personnel to get feedback and challenge my ideas.</p>
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>I ended up creating a full-blown design system for Bizo products. It housed a completely prototyped version of our entire platform (including numerous iterations on specific UIs). I added documentation on how to create consistent user experiences and documented the design patterns we had added and customized.</p>
            <p>After we were acquired by LinkedIn, I kept it up to date as a resource for building <router-link to="/lead-accelerator">Lead Accelerator</router-link> by incorporating LinkedIn UI patterns.</p>

            <p>The key advantage of this design system is how scalable it was. The pattern library and the products stayed in sync, with minimal effort on my part.</p>

            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>Car insurance customers are very focused on price, sometimes too focused. If you purchase a policy with the lowest limits available and cause an accident that puts someone in the hospital, you could use up your insurance quickly and be on the hook for the rest.</p>
            <p>I led the creation of a tool that provides better information so that people can shop from a perspective of protecting themselves and others, instead of solely focusing on saving money.</p>
            <h2>Approach</h2>
            <img class="project-image"
              src="images/work/esurance/coverage-counselor/coverage-counselor-flow.png" alt="Coverage Counselor experience flow"
            />
            <p class="floating-caption">Coverage Counselor user flow</p>
            <p>The key to the success of this project was getting a great team together. I was lucky to get a great writer, visual designer, and front-end developer to work with me while I focused on the product management and UX design.</p>
            <p>One of the biggest hurdles was the regulatory and legal implications of the project. As an insurance company we can't recommend specific coverage to customers, so we needed to structure the app as an educational experience guided by customer actions.</p>
            <img class="project-image"
              src="images/work/esurance/coverage-counselor/early-designs-close.jpg" alt="Early wireframes"
            />
            <p class="floating-caption">Early wireframes</p>
            <p>We did in-person user research to test and refine our designs. One finding was that our experience seemed a little overwhelming, so we added introductory steps before each set of questions to center the user's expectations and introduce the next part of the experience.</p>
            <h2>Solution</h2>

              <p>Promoting Coverage Counselor at SXSW.</p>
            </div>
            <p>The experience walks you through the main types of coverage (liability, vehicle, etc) and as you answer questions, it explains how that coverage works and shows personalized suggestions that might be appropriate.</p>
            <p>When you have a personalized list of suggestions, we made it easy talk to an agent or purchase that coverage online. You can also email or print your suggestions so you can shop with them elsewhere.</p>
            <p>Customers who went through the Coverage Counselor experience purchased higher levels of coverage. The tool was also a first of its kind in the space, so we were able to highlight it in our marketing efforts.</p>

            <p class="floating-caption">Depending on your ZIP code, hitting "go" takes you into <router-link to="/customer-flow">Customer Flow</router-link> or Quick Compare.</p>
            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>Car insurance prices vary by location, and there were ZIP codes where Esurance's rates weren't as low as our competitors. We wanted to find a way to monetize traffic that was visiting our site in these areas where people were unlikely to purchase from us.</p>
            <h2>Approach</h2>
            <div class="sidebar">
              <img src="images/work/esurance/quick-compare/top-form-square.png" alt="Alternate design for Quick Compare"/>
              <p>An early design with the form on top.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Our main <router-link to="/customer-flow">Customer Flow</router-link> experience already included affiliate links along with a quote for people who were unlikely to purchase from us, but in this case it made sense to create an entirely separate experience.</p>
            <p>Instead of taking customers through a long series of questions to get an uncompetitive price, I designed a single-page experience that shows estimated rates from Esurance and a few other companies, along with a few default inputs that could be changed to get closer to an accurately quoted price.</p>
            <p>I prototyped and launched this one-page experience quickly, and was able to use the website tracking analytics and data from the partner phone traffic to improve the design.</p>
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <img class="project-image"
              src="images/work/esurance/quick-compare/full-page-version.png" alt="Quick Compare design"
            />
            <div class="sidebar">
              <img src="images/work/esurance/quick-compare/syndicated.png" alt="Version for syndication"/>
              <p>I also developed a version for syndication on other websites.</p>
            </div>
            <p>If you're in a ZIP code where Esurance isn't competitive, we show competitor prices instantly. There's a form to personalize the generic prices in real time, but the main call to action is visible without taking any additional action.</p>
            <p>Launching quickly and iterating based on our data made sense because of the way we could easily test changes to the design and quantify their impact. One major change was the form, which was originally in a horizontal bar at the top of the page reminiscent of an advanced search pattern. Putting it on the left side of the page eased several design challenges and helped users focus on the prices and calls to action first. Another was always keeping Esurance at the top of the list, and maintaining a way to continue online with us for those customers set on doing so.</p>
            <p>This design proved to be a success, and outperformed Customer Flow in a lot of ZIP codes where Esurance rates were higher.</p>

            />
            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>When you visit <a href="http://www.esurance.com" target="_blank">esurance.com</a>, the experience after you type in your ZIP code is called Customer Flow. It guides you through getting an insurance quote and hopefully, purchasing a policy.</p>
            <p>Our user research showed that customers gave a lot of attention to discounts they received during the quote process. Greater discounts made them more likely to purchase even if the final price was similar to a competitor's quote.</p>
            <p>I worked on a project to leverage our discount opportunities more effectively in our quote flow design.</p>
            <h2>Approach</h2>
            <div class="sidebar">
              <img src="images/work/esurance/customer-flow/renters-header.png" alt="Price with discounts amount treatment"/>
              <img src="images/work/esurance/customer-flow/discounts-sidebar.png" alt="Showing discount amounts in sidebar"/>
              <p>I explored highlighting discounts in different places throughout the quote flow, as well as alternate treatments concurrent to the final price.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Instead of showing only the total discount amount along with the final quote, I aimed to highlight discount opportunities during the quote flow and help customers track the discounts they earned in a shopping cart as they progressed.</p>
            <p>I sketched potential changes to customer flow on paper to imagine alternate layouts that could highlight discounts. I explored strategies for presenting the discount information alongside the final quote price. Finally, I mocked up several of the designs for an eye tracking study, to find where the optimal places on the page were to put discount information.</p>
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>The final design consisted of three parts: altering questions asked during the quoting process to highlight when they led to discounts, tracking discounts acquired in a list as the user progressed through the flow, and finally breaking down the total and itemized discounts amounts in conjunction with the final quote price.</p>
            <img class="project-image" src="images/work/esurance/customer-flow/discount-equation.png" alt="Breaking out discounts alongside price"/>
            <p class="floating-caption">The best-performing version put detailed discount information in the most prominent location.</p>
            <p>Split testing showed strong performance improvement with these changes, and we rolled them out to all users.</p>

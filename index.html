                <p>I came to LinkedIn through the Bizo acquisition and worked primarily on advertising products. I learned a lot and brought some Bizo goodness to LinkedIn's huge base of advertisers. After doing design here for almost two years, I moved into front-end engineering to sharpen my coding skills.</p>

                <p>I joined Bizo as the 75th employee, and first UX designer. From the time I interviewed I could tell it was a special place, and joining was the best decision of my career. I wanted to do UX on my own terms, and worked with the team to develop an innovative approach to product design. It paid off, and we were acquired by LinkedIn in 2014.</p>

                <p>Moving out to San Francisco and designing for Esurance was a big step in my career. I learned about e-commerce working on the insurance quoting and purchasing experience. Every change I made impacted the bottom line, so we tested and measured like nowhere I've seen since. It was thrilling to work on something with so much impact.</p>

              <h2>Building web products</h2>
              <p>I apply a user-centered design process that depends on iteration, customer feedback, and developing domain expertise. As I've grown as a designer, I've learned how to adapt that process specifically to product development on the web.</p>
              <p>I consistently hear from designers who are struggling to bring real change to their products, especially in the enterprise space. Their complaints have a common theme: There aren't enough engineers. The product managers won't prioritize design improvement. A redesign isn't worth the cost. Eventually they get burned out. Their best hope is to persuade stakeholders to change their priorities with a great design presentation. An uphill battle, and a never-ending one.</p>
              <p>I believe this is a solvable problem. Fixing it requires designers and stakeholders to reach outside their traditional comfort zones. When you can go no further, change. You will make it through.</p>
              <p>On an organizational level, a design group should learn how to change their products as much as possible while asking as little as possible from product management and engineering. You might think that I'm about to say &ldquo;designers should code&rdquo;, but the real requirement is only that the design <em>organization</em> should be capable of producing final designs in code. Design should be able to define the content and presentation layers for their products (HTML and CSS). Engineering should optimize and improve the code for production, but even taking this first step removes a tremendous amount of friction from product development and enables design craftsmanship in the end user experience.</p>
              <div class="sidebar">
                <p>My engineering counterpart at Bizo wrote about <a href="http://www.draconianoverlord.com/2016/07/22/staffing-a-front-end-team.html" target="_blank">his perspective</a> on this model.</p>
              </div>
              <p>Delivering final designs in code reduces the engineering cost to implement them. It provides a shared context for design and engineering collaboration and learning. It also prevents design bugs that can take additional effort to fix. The reduced engineering costs for design changes make them less costly to prioritize, producing a virtuous cycle of design improvement.</p>
              <p>For the design team, a code-based style library enables design consistency, clarity, and scalability in a way that image-based tools will never match.</p>
              <p>Design-led presentation layer code is a great first step. The next step is devoting dedicated engineering resources to design improvement. The surest way to degrade a product over time is to prioritize by weighing any design changes against new features. Design improvements provide long-term value and are hard to measure directly, so the new features will win every time.</p>
              <p>I helped a team solve this problem by setting a fixed percentage of our engineering budget each sprint for design improvements. I'd negotiate with the product team, but the design tasks for this dedicated budget were prioritized by design. If you have a design-oriented product manager you might not need to take on this responsibility, but I like when designers prioritize their design improvements. It fosters appreciation for the costs of the engineering work that provides valuable focus.</p>
              <div class="img-container-25">
                <img src="images/process/sketch.jpg" alt="Sketch of a metric table design">
                <p>starting an idea with a simple sketch&hellip;</p>
              </div>
              <p>As an individual contributor, I've always measured my work by its impact on real users. Nice mocks for my portfolio aren't very rewarding. So I get frustrated when a final product doesn't turn out as nicely as my carefully crafted Illustrator mocks. Many great designers have argued for designing in code. For me, the right to control the end result was what sold me.</p>
              <p>I started using image tools less often as I got better at CSS and my design system became more extensive. Eventually, I found that my process started with paper and pencil to explore ideas, then went directly into code to grapple with reality. There was no need for the intermediate step of drawing my whole interface in a graphics program beforehand. I only needed image tools to produce actual images to include in my designs. Using my "living styleguide" I could quickly build prototypes of entire experiences to demo and conduct research.</p>
              <div class="bizstrap-table-container">
                <hierarchical-table></hierarchical-table>
              </div>
              <p class="floating-caption">&hellip;and bringing it to life in code</p>
              <p>Not every designer should work the way that I do. I believe in letting people focus on their strengths. But many of the design decisions that have to be made for a web experience can't be shown in an image mockup, or even a prototype stitched together from static images. If you really want to control your product look and feel, you have to work directly in its medium. That will only become more true as the web becomes more fluid, animated, and dynamic.</p>
              <p>There's something very rewarding and authentic about working this way. For me it evokes Frank Lloyd Wright's architecture school, whose students don't just design structures while sitting at a desk, they go outside and build the shelters that they live in while at school. Or industrial designers creating physical prototypes. Imagination without constraints is an indispensable part of design, but so is overcoming the challenges of the medium to make real change achievable.</p>
              <h2>Building culture</h2>
              <p>Working in  very different company cultures over the years, I've learned what to look for and help grow in the organizations I'm part of. Things that turn a job into a deeply fulfilling endeavor.</p>
              <div class="img-container-50">
                <img
                  srcset="images/process/culture-1600.jpg 1600w,
                          images/process/culture-800.jpg 800w"
                  sizes="(min-width:70rem) 1120w, 100vw"
                  src="images/process/culture-1600.jpg" alt="Pictures with teammates"
                />
              </div>
              <p>The first is a culture of commitment. An innate sense of trust that fosters deep bonds between coworkers. It's easy to sense these kinds of cultures, they feel less stiff and more genuine. It doesn't mean that we always agree, but trust allows us to sort out disagreements productively. It means being your authentic self at work and sharing your perspective honestly. It also makes work a lot more fun. Without these bonds, a job loses its purpose and becomes a quid-pro-quo calculus &mdash; what I am giving and what I am getting.</p>
              <p>A culture of commitment enables the second thing I look for, an action-oriented culture where trust allows decision-making to move down the hierarchy. You have enough ownership of your work to make decisions without running them up the chain of command. You are included in decisions that will affect you whenever possible. Trust runs both ways, and people keep their managers informed and their work consistent with the company's standards.</p>
              <p>The last thing I look for is a focus on productivity that prevents unnecessary processes from building up. Teams figure out what works for them and modify it over time. Meetings are more likely to be one-offs scheduled for a purpose than recurring time-slots to be filled with content. This is worth underlining because meetings are very expensive. The more people attend, the more expensive the meeting. Sometimes big meetings are worth the cost, and if they are they should feel important and engage their participants.</p>
              <div class="img-container-35">
                <img src="images/process/pm-team.jpg" alt="Bizo PM Team">
                <p>a small but mighty team meeting </p>
              </div>
              <p>I'll admit that these traits are more likely to be found in smaller organizations, but I've also seen cases where adopting some of these qualities can allow larger companies to move faster and feel smaller than they are.</p>
              <p>Creating a great culture is an essential part of my process as a designer and employee. Not only because it's better for productivity, but because it's better for human happiness. Ultimately, what is the point of doing great work and finding success if not to improve human well-being?</p>

            <h1>Building Products</h1>
            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>Bizo was a fast-paced startup that developed B2B advertising products. In my time there, we built and launched Self-Service Retargeting, Bizo Switchboard, Social Retargeting, Bizo for Marketing Automation, <router-link to="/work/multichannel-nurturing">Multichannel Nurturing</router-link>, as well as a suite of <router-link to="/work/analytics">analytics</router-link> tools to support our primary display and social advertising business.</p>
            <p>As a single designer I needed a design system that would streamline the product development and iteration process. I needed to be able to create prototypes as well as actual product designs quickly so we could get them into customers' hands, get feedback, and keep learning.</p>
            <h2>Approach</h2>
            <p>In my interview, Bizo's head of engineering told me they wanted to start using <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> to build their UI, and were looking for a designer who could manage it. Despite my novice CSS skills at the time, I accepted the challenge.</p>
            <p>It was definitely hard at first, you can read a lot more about my evolution in <router-link to="/process">process</router-link>, but safe to say I got the hang of it and even found designing this way felt very natural.</p>
            <p>Working with the engineering team on product designs and having them review my code made us all more efficient and helped me level up my prototyping skills very quickly. I wasn't putting too many cycles into customizing Bootstrap's visual style at this point. You'll probably recognize that "vanilla Bootstrap" look in a lot of the UI elements.</p>
            <p>What I did spend time on was creating prototypes for all those product flows and validating them. I would build out several versions of a user flow. Once I had a few design options ready, I took them to my teammates, customers, and our field personnel to get feedback and challenge my ideas.</p>
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>I ended up creating a full-blown design system for Bizo products. It housed a completely prototyped version of our entire platform (including numerous iterations on specific UIs). I added documentation on how to create consistent user experiences and documented the design patterns we had added and customized.</p>
            <p>The key advantage of this design system is how scalable it was. Both the pattern library and the products stayed in sync, with minimal effort on my part.</p>

            <h1>Coverage Counselor</h1>
            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>Car insurance customers are very focused on price, sometimes too focused. If you purchase a policy with the lowest limits available and cause an accident that puts someone in the hospital, you could use up your insurance quickly and be on the hook for the rest.</p>
            <p>I led the creation of a tool that provides better information so that people can shop from a perspective of protecting themselves and others, instead of solely focusing on saving money.</p>
            <h2>Approach</h2>
            <p>The key to the success of this project was getting a great team together. I was lucky to get a great writer, visual designer, and front-end developer to work with me while I focused on the product management and UX design.</p>
            <p>One of the biggest hurdles was the regulatory and legal implications of the project. As an insurance company we can't recommend specific coverage to customers, so we needed to structure the app as an educational experience guided by customer actions.</p>
            <p>We did in-person user research to test and refine our designs. One finding was that our experience seemed a little overwhelming, so we added introductory steps before each set of questions to center the user's expectations and introduce the next part of the experience.</p>
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>The experience walks you through the main types of coverage (liability, vehicle, etc) and as you answer questions, it explains how that coverage works and shows personalized suggestions that might be appropriate.</p>
            <p>When you have a personalized list of suggestions, we made it easy talk to an agent or purchase that coverage online. You can also email or print your suggestions so you can shop with them elsewhere.</p>
            <p>Customers who went through the Coverage Counselor experience purchased higher levels of coverage. The tool was also a first of its kind in the space, so we were able to highlight it in our marketing efforts.</p>

            <h1>Quick Compare</h1>
            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>Car insurance prices vary by location, and there were ZIP codes where Esurance's rates weren't as low as our competitors. We wanted to find a way to monetize traffic that was visiting our site in these areas where people were unlikely to purchase from us.</p>
            <h2>Approach</h2>
            <p>Our main <router-link to="/work/customer-flow">Customer Flow</router-link> experience showed affiliate links along with a quote for people who were unlikely to purchase from us, but in this case it made sense to create an entirely separate experience.</p>
            <p>Instead of taking customers through a long series of questions to get an uncompetitive price, I designed a single-page experience that shows estimated rates from Esurance and a few other companies, along with a few default inputs that could be changed to get closer to an accurately quoted price.</p>
            <p>I prototyped and launched this one-page experience quickly, and was able to use the website tracking analytics and data from the partner phone traffic to improve the design.</p>
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>If you're in a ZIP code where Esurance isn't competitive, we show competitor prices instantly. There's a form to personalize the generic prices in real time, but the main call to action is visible without taking any additional action.</p>
            <p>Launching quickly and iterating based on our data made sense because of the way we could easily test changes to the design and quantify their impact. One major change was the form, which was originally in a horizontal bar at the top of the page reminiscent of an advanced search pattern. Putting it on the left side of the page eased several design challenges and helped users focus on the prices and calls to action first. Another was always keeping Esurance at the top of the list, and maintaining a way to continue online with us for those customers set on doing so.</p>
            <p>This design proved to be a success, and outperformed Customer Flow in a lot of ZIP codes where Esurance rates were higher.</p>

            <h1>Customer Flow</h1>
            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>When you visit <a href="http://www.esurance.com" target="_blank">esurance.com</a>, the experience after you type in your ZIP code is called Customer Flow. It guides you through getting an insurance quote and hopefully, purchasing a policy.</p>
            <p>Our user research showed that customers gave a lot of attention to discounts they received during the quote process. Greater discounts made them more likely to purchase even if the final price was similar to a competitor's quote.</p>
            <p>I worked on a project to leverage our discount opportunities more effectively in our quote flow design.</p>
            <h2>Approach</h2>
            <p>Instead of just showing the total number of discount amount along with the final quote, I aimed to highlight discount opportunities during the quote flow and help customers track the discounts they earned in a shopping cart as they progressed.</p>
            <p>I sketched potential changes to customer flow on paper to imagine alternate layouts that could highlight discounts. I explored strategies for presenting the discount information alongside the final quote price. Finally, I mocked up several of the designs for an eye tracking study, to find where the optimal places on the page were to put discount information.</p>

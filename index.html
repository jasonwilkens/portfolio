          <p>I'm Jason Wilkens, a designer and developer of products and experiences on the web.</p>
          <h2>What I do</h2>
          <p>UX design is a big umbrella, covering a lot of folks with different skills and interests. I don't really spend time parsing the differences between interaction designers, product designers, UX architects, and so on but I do want to provide an idea of who I am as a designer and what I like to do.</p>
          <p>I'm probably not the right designer to create a beautiful illustration or logo, but I'm great at designing software products or design systems for the web.</p>

          <p>I thought Esurance was big, but LinkedIn is on another level. People don't realize how many products LinkedIn has. Dozens of designers on a ton of different teams, and a structure around them trying to keep them all consistent and aligned. I did design here for about two years, then moved into front-end engineering to sharpen my coding skills. <strong>Capstone:</strong> Masterminded the plan to merge Bizo and LinkedIn products and refocus our business, and named it after a Beatsteaks song.</p>

          <p>I joined Bizo as its 75th employee, and first UX designer. From the time I interviewed with them I could tell it was a special company, and joining was the best decision of my career. I wanted to do UX on my own terms, and I wound up working with the team to develop an innovative approach to product design. It paid off, and we were acquired by LinkedIn in 2014. <strong>Proudest Moment:</strong> Pulled an all-nighter working out a concept for what became our signature product just in time for a big meeting.</p>

          <p>I jumped at the chance to move out to San Francisco and work for Esurance. I learned about e-commerce working on the insurance quoting and purchasing UX. Every change I made to the site impacted the bottom line, and we measured the hell out of it. It was thrilling to work on something with so much impact. <strong>Highlight:</strong> Seeing national TV ads running for a product I designed to help people get the right coverage.</p>

          <p>Remember McGruff the Crime Dog? He's the intellectual property of a little non-profit that gave me my first chance to get paid for doing something UX-related. I was one half of the website team, and got my fingers in a lot of pies. We had big dreams, but funding usually got in the way of doing something cool. Best story was the time I took down the org's email for two days trying to save $10 on domain registration. <strong>Bonus:</strong> I got to wear the McGruff costume a couple times in public.</p>

          <p>I double-majored in Management Information Systems and Operations Management at UA. It was a great program for learning about technology and business. The course that really inspired me was User Interface Design. I'd never realized that designing UIs could be a career. It seemed like the most fun part of building software, and it captured my imagination. That class planted the seed, even if it took me a couple years to get a chance to work in UX full time. <strong>Fondest Memories:</strong> Doing shows on <a href="http://kamp.arizona.edu/" target="_blank">KAMP Student Radio</a> and going on <a href="http://campwildcat.org/" target="_blank">Camp Wildcat</a> camps.</p>

          <h2>Developing web products</h2>
          <p>I've worked in a few different product design organizations, have spoken at and listened to peers at design events, and thought deeply about the role of design on the web over the years. One thing I've consistently noticed is designers struggle to make real changes to the products they work on, especially in the enterprise space. There's never enough engineering resources, the PM won't prioritize it, etc. Often they feel powerless, their best hope is to put on a big presentation to convince a bunch of stakeholders that what they want to do is less important than what the designers want to do. An uphill battle to say the least, and one that must be fought over and over again.</p>
          <p>On an organizational level, my experiences tell me that a healthy product development process includes a design group with the ability to change their products as much as possible while asking as little as possible from product management and engineering. You might think (especially if you're familiar with my background) that I'm about to say &ldquo;designers should code&rdquo;, but the real requirement is only that the design <em>organization</em> should be capable of coding. At the very least, design should define the content and presentation layers for their products. Even that ability removes a tremendous amount of friction from product development and enables design craftsmanship in the end user experience.</p>
          <p>Delivering final designs in code reduces the engineering cost of implementing them. It also prevents most of the design bugs that take additional effort to fix, improving efficiency even more. The reduced engineering costs for design changes make them less costly for product management to prioritize, producing a virtuous cycle of real design improvement.</p>
          <p>As far as benefits for the design team, a code-based style library enables design consistency, clarity, and scalability in a way that image-based tools will never match.</p>
          <p>Design-led presentation layer code is a great first step. The next step is devoting dedicated engineering resources to design improvement. The surest way to degrade a product over time is to prioritize a roadmap by weighing any design changes against spending on new features. Design improvements provide long-term value and are hard to measure directly, so the new features will win every time.</p>
          <p>I worked on a team that achieved this by setting a fixed percentage of our engineering budget for each sprint toward design improvements. I'd collaborate and haggle with the PMs, but the design tasks were prioritized by designers. If you have a design-oriented PM they could potentially be dedicated to prioritizing UX, but I like having designers prioritize their design improvements. It fosters appreciation for the costs of improvement that provides valuable focus.</p>
          <p>To look at the design process from an individual contributor perspective, I've always measured my work by the impact it made on users in the real world. Nice mocks for my portfolio just aren't very rewarding on their own. So I get frustrated when my final product doesn't turn out as nice as my carefully crafted Illustrator mocks. Many great designers have written persuasive arguments for designing in code. For me, the right to control the end result was what sold me.</p>
          <p>I started using image tools less and less as I got better at CSS and my pattern library became more extensive. Eventually, I found that my process started with paper and pencil to explore ideas without constraints, then went directly into code to grapple with reality. I only used image tools to actually produce images to include in my designs. I could quickly build design prototypes of entire experiences to play with and conduct research.</p>
          <p>I don't think that every designer should work the way that I do. I believe in letting people focus on their strengths, and not every designer needs to code. But many of the design decisions that have to be made for a web experience can't be shown in an image mockup. If you really want to control what your product looks and feels like, you have to work directly in it's medium. That will only become more true as the web becomes more fluid, animated, and dynamic.</p>
          <p>There's something rewarding and authentic about working this way. It makes me think of the students at Frank Lloyd Wright's architecture school, who don't just design structures, they actually build the shelters they will live in while at school. Or industrial designers who build physical prototypes once they're finished sketching. Imagination without constraints is an indispensable part of design, but so is overcoming the challenges of the medium to make real change achievable.</p>
          <h2>How I think about design reviews</h2>
          <p>I've experienced both good and bad processes for reviewing and iterating on design work. It's easier to define the good processes by how they differ from the bad than by offering vague descriptions of &ldquo;empowerment&rdquo; that even a habitual micro-manager could nod along with. The worst review processes are hierarchical - iterate for your manager until they approve, then iterate for their manager until they approve, and so on. The next worst are committee-based - get as many designers and stakeholders as you can into a room and solicit feedback from them all. Put pressure on them to sound smart and come up with something even if they've never thought about the problem-space before. Then iterate to try to make everyone happy (or at least the highest-ranking people).</p>
          <p>These processes have a harmful effect on product quality and slow down work because they aren't very scalable. Informed opinions are good, but more of them doesn't always lead to more value. I think the maximum number of people in a review should be about six. Reviews should focus on the problems that still need to be solved. Discuss alternatives but don't try to design them in the meeting. I stay synced with my PM during my entire design process outside reviews so we can both focus on the rest of the discussion during them.</p>
          <p>Even the most valuable reviews are no substitute for the insight you'll get from real users, so use reviews to get enough informed feedback to make sure the design has a good chance of working for them. Don't let reviews become a bottleneck that delays the potentially disrupting insights you'll get from user research.</p>
          <h2>Culture</h2>
          <p>While working in some very different company cultures over the years, I've learned what to look for and help grow in the organizations I'm part of. The things that turn a job into a deeply fulfilling endeavor.</p>
          <p>The first is a culture of commitment. An innate sense of trust that fosters deep emotional bonds between coworkers. It's easy to sense these kinds of cultures, they feel less stiff and more genuine. It doesn't mean that everyone always agrees, but trust allows people to sort out disagreements productively. It allows people to be their authentic selves at work and share their perspectives honestly. It also makes work a lot more fun. Without this bond, a job loses its purpose and becomes a quid-pro-quo calculus - what am I giving versus what am I getting.</p>
          <p>A culture of commitment enables the second thing I look for, an action-oriented culture where trust allows decision-making to move down the hierarchy. People have enough ownership of their work to make decisions without running them up the chain of command. People are included in decisions that will affect them whenever possible. Trust runs both ways, and people keep their managers informed and their work consistent with the company's standards.</p>
          <p>The last thing I look for is a focus on productivity that prevents unnecessary processes from building up. Teams figure out what works for them and modify it over time. Meetings are more likely to be one-offs scheduled for a purpose than recurring time-slots to be filled with content. This is worth underlining because meetings are very expensive. The more people attend the more expensive the meeting is. Sometimes it's worth it, but it's very hard for a large recurring meeting to hold people's attention.</p>
          <p>I'll admit that these traits are more likely to be found in smaller organizations, but I've also seen cases where adopting some of these qualities can allow larger companies to move faster and feel smaller than they are.</p>

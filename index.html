              <p>I came to LinkedIn through the Bizo acquisition and worked primarily on advertising products. I learned a lot and brought some Bizo goodness to LinkedIn's huge base of advertisers. After doing design here for almost two years, I moved into front-end engineering to sharpen my coding skills.</p>

            <p>I'm Jason Wilkens, a designer and developer of products and experiences on the web.</p>
            <h2>What I do</h2>
            <p>UX design is a big umbrella, covering a lot of folks with different skills and interests. I don't really spend time parsing the differences between interaction designers, product designers, UX architects, and so on but I do want to provide an idea of who I am as a designer and what I like to do.</p>
            <p>I'm probably not the right designer to create a beautiful illustration or logo, but I'm great at designing software products or design systems for the web. I like to build things that make people more productive and help them feel informed, capable and efficient.</p>

              <h2>Developing web products</h2>
              <p>I've worked in a few different product design organizations, have spoken at and listened to peers at design events, and thought deeply about the role of design on the web over the years. One thing I've consistently noticed is designers struggle to make real changes to the products they work on, especially in the enterprise space. There's never enough engineering resources, the PM won't prioritize it, etc. Often they feel powerless, their best hope is to put on a big presentation to convince a bunch of stakeholders that what they want to do is less important than what the designers want to do. An uphill battle to say the least, and one that must be fought over and over again.</p>
              <p>On an organizational level, my experiences tell me that a healthy product development process includes a design group with the ability to change their products as much as possible while asking as little as possible from product management and engineering. You might think (especially if you're familiar with my background) that I'm about to say &ldquo;designers should code&rdquo;, but the real requirement is only that the design <em>organization</em> should be capable of coding. At the very least, design should be able to define the content and presentation layers for their products (basic HTML and CSS). Engineering should optimize and improve the code for production, but even that ability removes a tremendous amount of friction from product development and enables design craftsmanship in the end user experience.</p>
              <p>Delivering final designs in code reduces the engineering cost of implementing them. It also prevents most of the design bugs that take additional effort to fix, improving efficiency even more. The reduced engineering costs for design changes make them less costly for product management to prioritize, producing a virtuous cycle of real design improvement.</p>
              <p>As far as benefits for the design team, a code-based style library enables design consistency, clarity, and scalability in a way that image-based tools will never match.</p>
              <p>Design-led presentation layer code is a great first step. The next step is devoting dedicated engineering resources to design improvement. The surest way to degrade a product over time is to prioritize a roadmap by weighing any design changes against spending on new features. Design improvements provide long-term value and are hard to measure directly, so the new features will win every time.</p>
              <p>I worked on a team that achieved this by setting a fixed percentage of our engineering budget for each sprint toward design improvements. I'd collaborate and haggle with the PMs, but the design tasks were prioritized by designers. If you have a design-oriented PM they could potentially be dedicated to prioritizing UX, but I like having designers prioritize their design improvements. It fosters appreciation for the costs of improvement that provides valuable focus.</p>
              <p>To look at the design process from an individual contributor perspective, I've always measured my work by the impact it made on users in the real world. Nice mocks for my portfolio just aren't very rewarding on their own. So I get frustrated when my final product doesn't turn out as nice as my carefully crafted Illustrator mocks. Many great designers have written persuasive arguments for designing in code. For me, the right to control the end result was what sold me.</p>
              <p>I started using image tools less as I got better at CSS and my pattern library became more extensive. Eventually, I found that my process started with paper and pencil to explore ideas without constraints, then went directly into code to grapple with reality. I only used image tools to actually produce images to include in my designs. I could quickly build design prototypes of entire experiences to play with and conduct research.</p>
              <p>I don't think that every designer should work the way that I do. I believe in letting people focus on their strengths, and not every designer needs to code. But many of the design decisions that have to be made for a web experience can't be shown in an image mockup. If you really want to control what your product looks and feels like, you have to work directly in it's medium. That will only become more true as the web becomes more fluid, animated, and dynamic.</p>
              <p>There's something rewarding and authentic about working this way. It makes me think of the students at Frank Lloyd Wright's architecture school, who don't just design structures, they actually build the shelters they will live in while at school. Or industrial designers who build physical prototypes once they're finished sketching. Imagination without constraints is an indispensable part of design, but so is overcoming the challenges of the medium to make real change achievable.</p>
              <h2>Conducting design reviews</h2>
              <p>There are a couple guidelines I try to follow when conducting reviews on design work. I try to keep the meeting fairly small, including just the key stakeholders and designers. Ideally no more than six people. Having more doesn't necessarily generate better feedback and can kill a collaborative dynamic.</p>
              <p>I also try to lessen the impact of organizational hierarchy on reviewing and approving designs. In design reviews (as in most things), I prefer to place decision-making in the hands of those closest to the problems being solved.</p>
              <p>Following these two rules keeps design iteration running efficiently and helps the review process scale in growing organizations. Efficiency is important because even the most valuable reviews are no substitute for insights from real users, so I like to use reviews to get enough informed feedback to proceed to user research. I don't want them to be a bottleneck that delays the potentially disrupting insights that will come out of research.</p>
              <h2>Culture</h2>
              <p>Creating a great culture is an essential part of my process as a designer and employee. Not only because it's better for productivity, but because it's better for human happiness. Ultimately, what is the point of doing great work and finding success if not to improve human well-being?</p>
              <p>While working in some very different company cultures over the years, I've learned what to look for and help grow in the organizations I'm part of. The things that turn a job into a deeply fulfilling endeavor.</p>
              <p>The first is a culture of commitment. An innate sense of trust that fosters deep bonds between coworkers. It's easy to sense these kinds of cultures, they feel less stiff and more genuine. It doesn't mean that we always agree, but trust allows us to sort out disagreements productively. It means being your authentic self at work and sharing your perspective honestly. It also makes work a lot more fun. Without these bonds, a job loses its purpose and becomes a quid-pro-quo calculus - what am I giving versus what am I getting.</p>
              <p>A culture of commitment enables the second thing I look for, an action-oriented culture where trust allows decision-making to move down the hierarchy. You have enough ownership of your work to make decisions without running them up the chain of command. You are included in decisions that will affect you whenever possible. Trust runs both ways, and people keep their managers informed and their work consistent with the company's standards.</p>
              <p>The last thing I look for is a focus on productivity that prevents unnecessary processes from building up. Teams figure out what works for them and modify it over time. Meetings are more likely to be one-offs scheduled for a purpose than recurring time-slots to be filled with content. This is worth underlining because meetings are very expensive. The more people attend the more expensive the meeting is. Sometimes it's worth it, but it's very hard for a large recurring meeting to hold people's attention.</p>
              <p>I'll admit that these traits are more likely to be found in smaller organizations, but I've also seen cases where adopting some of these qualities can allow larger companies to move faster and feel smaller than they are.</p>

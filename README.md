JavaScript
----------
I used [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) for creating components, with [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/en/) for routing. I added [Headroom.js](http://wicky.nillia.ms/headroom.js/) to animate my nav bar.

CSS
---
I used [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) to write my CSS, [Profound Grid](http://www.profoundgrid.com/) to add a grid system, and the "[lobotomized owl](https://alistapart.com/article/axiomatic-css-and-lobotomized-owls)" technique to create spacing rules.

Type
----
I used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) (Playfair Display and Yantramanav) for my typefaces, and the fluid type pattern described [here](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/05/fluid-typography/) to make the type responsive.

Color
-----
I used theme colors from my two Twitter accounts as my primary interaction colors (green and purple), along with Diana Mounter's [Vantablack palette](http://broccolini.net/50shadesofblk/).

Photographs
-----------
I took almost all the photographs used, and the rest were taken by coworkers. I used media queries in my CSS to make background images responsive. For images that were part of my content, I used the srcset attribute to make them responsive.

Images
------
The non-photographic images are all SVG. I created a few SVGs for things like arrow icons. I downloaded the LinkedIn and Twitter logos from their public brand packages and stripped out some extra code before including. I used [Twemoji](https://github.com/twitter/twemoji) for the emojis.

Contact Form
------------
I use [PostMail](https://postmail.invotes.com/) to send me messages from my contact form.

Hosting
-------
I use [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) to build and manage the site.
